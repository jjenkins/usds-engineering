# USDS Engineering Take-Home Assessment

## Purpose
The United States Federal Government has over 200,000 pages of federal regulations across ~150 main agencies, all of which can be found within the eCFR at https://www.ecfr.gov/. There is a public API for it. 
The goal of this assessment is to create a simple website to analyze Federal Regulations to allow for more digestible and actionable insights to be made on potential deregulation efforts across the government.
